[ PARAMETER SUMMARY ]
  - Maximum Specific Growth Rate (μ_max): 50.0 h⁻¹
  - Half-Saturation Constant (K_s):      50.0 g/L

[ INTERPRETATION ]
1. Substrate Affinity:
   The K_s value of 50.0 g/L represents the substrate concentration at which the growth rate is half of its maximum.
   > A LOW K_s value indicates a HIGH affinity of the microorganism for the substrate, meaning it can grow efficiently even when the substrate is scarce.
   > A HIGH K_s value indicates a LOW affinity, meaning the organism needs a higher concentration of the substrate to grow effectively.

2. Maximum Growth Potential:
   The theoretical maximum growth rate (μ_max) for this organism under these conditions is 50.0 h⁻¹.
   As the graph shows, the growth rate approaches this value asymptotically but never truly exceeds it, as the substrate becomes less of a limiting factor.

3. Key Benchmark:
   At a substrate concentration of exactly 50.0 g/L (the K_s value), the calculated specific growth rate is 25.000 h⁻¹, confirming it is exactly half of μ_max.
